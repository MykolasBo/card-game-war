# card-game-war
This is an implementation of the card game, called War, in Python.

War is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard card deck. The objective of the game is to collect all cards and hereby win a game! 

Below are specific requirements for the program implemented by me:

- Game is played by two players. One is computer, another one is a user, who types in his name.
- Game is played with a standard deck of playing cards - 52 cards, no jokers.
- Cards are shuffled in random order at the beginning of the game and delt evenly among both players.
- Highest card is Ace (A), whereas lowest card is Two (2).
- Game is played in "battles" (rounds). In each "battle" each player places one card facing up on the table. Player with a higher card wins and takes both cards to his pile of cards.
- If during a ""battle" both cards are of the same rank, a "war" occurs. Then each player places one card facedown and one card face-up on top of the facedown card. Player with a higher face-up card wins and takes all cards to his pile of cards. If both face-up cards are of the same rank again, new "war" occurs. It's repeated until one player's face up card is higher than the other's or until one player is left without cards in his pile.
- To place a card, player picks it from the top of his pile.
- Won cards are always placed at the bottom of players pile.
- Game ends when one player is left without any cards in his pile.
- Player with cards is declared a winner. He might either have all 52 cards in his pile or not (if consecutive wars with no outcome occur and one player runs out of cards as described above).
 

p.s. please stop the war & live in peace. :) Slava Ukraini!
